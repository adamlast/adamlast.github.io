## About Grow UI

This is a work in progress based on the Laravel web framework. It is a UI for modifying IoT configuration files that can be deployed to the IoT devices either using S3 or a direct API integration.

## Disclaimer

We would like to extend our thanks to Pimoroni who developed the Grow Monitor software and Raspberry Pi Growhat. We are building on and extending their work.
